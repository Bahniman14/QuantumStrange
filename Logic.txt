Background: In the original story docter strange in searching through 14,000,605 possible futures. The closest ineger of power of 2 is 2^24 = 16,777,216. If we want to perform grower's algorithm to search in a data set of size 2^24, we need 24 qubits(Quantum bits).
Limitations: As we increase the number of qubits, the space of possibilities grows exponentially, and finding a specific state becomes increasingly unlikely because Grover's algorithm follows a probabilistic approch. To make the System effective and to aline with objective with the project, we have developed a 8-bit circuit. As understanding levels up in the research of Quantum computing, we expect a scale up in the circuit of this project.
Logic: Measuring number of comparions/operations needed is a better approch than calculating time taken because measuring time is platform dependent. we are considering the state '1' as a favorable posibility for the avengers and '0' as not. when all the situations will be favorable to the avengers, that will be reffered as the exact future where avengers can win. To execute this operation we are simultaniously executing a Quantum algorithm(Grover's diffusion algorithms) and a classical algorithm(Linear Search) in the all possible 8-bit binary sequences to find excatly 8-bit sequnce of '1 ' (favorable outcome). In this way we are practically demonstrating the exponential speed-up quantum computing can offer in comparison to classical computaion.

Background: In the original story, Doctor Strange looked into an astounding 14,000,605 possible futures. If we imagine this as a massive dataset, the closest 'power of 2' that fits is 16,777,216. To explore this dataset effectively, we'd need 24 qubits(Quantum bits) circuit.

Limitations: With an increase in the number of qubits, the complexity of potential states grows exponentially. Consequently, pinpointing a specific state becomes increasingly improbable, given Grover's algorithm operates on a probabilistic basis. To strike an equilibrium between effectiveness and project objectives, we've designed an 8-qubit circuit. As our understanding of quantum computing advances, we anticipate a scalability in the circuit's complexity.

Logic: To gauge the efficiency of our system, we're focusing on measuring the number of comparisons and operations required. This provides a more reliable benchmark than tracking time, which can be influenced by the specifics of the computing platform.

We've set up a system where we treat '1' as a favorable outcome for the Avengers, and '0' as unfavorable. The objective is to pinpoint the exact future where all scenarios are favorable for the Avengers. To achieve this, we're simultaneously running a Quantum algorithm (specifically, Grover's diffusion algorithm) and a classical algorithm (Linear Search) across all possible 8-bit binary sequences. These two approaches helps us individually to identify the precise 8-bit sequence of '1s' that represents the favorable outcome. This demonstration showcases the exponential acceleration that quantum computing can bring, compared to classical computation.
